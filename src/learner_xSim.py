This Python script is an agent-based simulation to generate learner experiences in U.S. Army marksmanship training for
the express purpose of demonstrating how data collected from user learning/training experiences can be used to enhance
training effectiveness and course evaluation.

The intent of this script it to read a GIFT (see gifttutoring.org) survey and generate agent-specific responses, then
simulate gateway exercise/assessments as a practicum. The included case simulates basic rifle marksmanship (BRM)
training and follows the data collection pattern that Problem Solutions uses in their REAPER experiments.

Other scripts associated with this simulation will read and analyze data generated by this simulation. In real life,
that data will be stored to a learning record store (LRS). For the sake of simplicity, this script stores data in JSON
documents.
